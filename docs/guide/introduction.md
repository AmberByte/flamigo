:::

Flamigo is an open-source, Domain-Driven backend framework designed for building high-performance, scalable applications in Go. It encourages a clean architectural structure by enforcing separation of concerns, making your codebase easier to maintain, test, and extend.

Flamigo is built on top of proven Go libraries like `gorilla`, and adds powerful features such as dependency injection, event-driven communication between domains, and real-time frontend support â€” all out of the box. Whether you're building a microservice, a monolith, or anything in between, Flamigo helps you focus on your business logic without getting lost in boilerplate.
