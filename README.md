**Flamigo** is a lightweight and opinionated Go framework built around **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. It gives you structure without getting in your way â€” offering a clean architecture where domains, aggregates, and events are first-class citizens.

Whether you're working on a game backend, a microservice, or a monolith, Flamigo helps you write code that's easy to reason about, easy to scale, and fun to build on.

## ðŸ¦© Why Flamigo?

Flamigo puts Domain principles at the heart of your application, encouraging you to think in terms of business logic and domain boundaries. With a modular design, clear separation of concerns, and minimal dependencies, it keeps things lean and understandable. Event-driven patterns are baked in from the start, making it easy to decouple logic without resorting to brittle hacks.

You get all the power of Go â€” fast builds, static typing, and simplicity â€” without sacrificing structure or long-term maintainability.

## Getting Started

Install the CLI tool:

```bash
go install github.com/amberbyte/flamigo/tools/flamigo@latest
```

Then start a new project:

```bash
flamigo init
```

This start a wizard and sets up the basic structure
