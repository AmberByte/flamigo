## 🛠 What You Can Help With

Whether it's fixing a bug, improving documentation, or suggesting a new pattern for domain structuring — it's all valuable. Some great ways to contribute include:

## 🧑‍💻 Development Setup

To get started locally:

   ```

2. Run tests:

   ```

We aim to keep the codebase idiomatic, modular, and clean — please follow existing conventions wherever possible.

## Commit Style

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep our history readable and semantically meaningful. Examples:

- `feat(domain): add user aggregate`
- `fix: handle nil pointer in event dispatcher`
- `docs: improve getting started section`

This helps with changelogs and versioning.
